Code Kata For Kids
----
These are some code kata (short exercises) that I wrote with the intention of teaching my kids to write code.

In my opinion - ages 7+, a kid might be able to solve these on their own with some syntax coaching.

For ages <7, a kid might find it entertaining to write code, but your going to have to stand behind them and tell them everything to type.

I tried to chose exercises that don't require much English reading and writing skills.
